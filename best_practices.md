# Adopt a simplified development approach focused on reliability within Figma's specialized plugin environment

Key practices include

1. Structure: Use a single HTML file containing both inline CSS and inline JavaScript.
2. DOM Interaction: Prefer direct DOM manipulation over complex state management libraries or frameworks.
3. Execution: Implement immediate code execution rather than relying on events like window.onload.
4. Data Structures: Utilize simple data structures, such as arrays and basic JavaScript objects, instead of complex TypeScript interfaces or classes.
5. Logic: Simplify decision tree structures, aiming for fewer conditional branches where possible.
6. Development Strategy: Employ progressive enhancement, starting with core minimal functionality and building upon it incrementally.
7. Robustness: Incorporate defensive programming techniques, such as using try/catch blocks for error handling and performing null/undefined checks.
8. Debugging: Make extensive use of console.log statements for debugging purposes.
